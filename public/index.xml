      <description>In this section we are going to verify the connection between the PHP application and the locally-running MySQL database.
To find the public IP of your lightsail intance check the card for your instance on the Lightsail console home page.   To see the running application point your web browser to http://&amp;lt;lightsail instance public IP&amp;gt;/. If everything is configured correctly you should see a notification that you have no tasks.</description>

      <description>In this section we&amp;rsquo;ll deploy a Lightsail database. Lightsail databases are a managed database service that allow you to get away from the complexity of deploying and managing database software. Lightsail manages the underlying infrastructure and database engine, you only need to worry about creating and deploying the actual databases and tables running inside the service.
 From the Lightsail console home page select Databases from the horizontal menu
 Click Create database</description>

      <description>Lightsail makes it super simple to create snapshots of your instances with a single click. These snapshots can be used to backup and restore instances, scale instance sizes up or down, and/or to deploy a new instance.
 Return to the Lightsail console home page
 Click the 3 dot menu for the PHP-fe-1 instance and choose Manage
 From the horizontal menu choose Snapshots
 Click Create snapshot

      <title>1.3 - Create the load balancer</title>
      <link>http://lightsailworkshop.com/lamp/lab1/create_lb.html</link>

      <description>In order to provide scalability and fault tolerance you will be deploying your web front end behind a Lightsail load balancer. Lightsail load balancers handle both HTTP and HTTPS traffic on ports 80 and 443 respectively. For HTTPS you can request a free certificate from AWS certificate manager (although configuring HTTPS connections is out of scope for this workshop).
 Return to the Lightsail console home page and choose Networking from the horizontal menu.</description>
